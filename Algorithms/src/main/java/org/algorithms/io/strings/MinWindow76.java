/**
 * Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window
 * substring
 *  of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
 *
 * The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
 * Output: "BANC"
 * Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "a", t = "a"
 * Output: "a"
 * Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
